# Inspiration
- John Sundell's [Publish](https://github.com/JohnSundell/Publish)
- Laszlo Teveli's [Eval](https://github.com/tevelee/Eval) - for a list of modifiers to use, and for the concept of "spaceless" block

# Used a few utility classes from third parties
I could have as well rewritten those small utility classes, but, given their licenses, I chose to include them, so as to showcase my inspiration!

Following are the sources of utility classes in the "ThirdParty" folder
- JohnSundell's [Files](https://github.com/JohnSundell/Files), [Publish](https://github.com/JohnSundell/Publish/blob/master/Sources/Publish)
- JohnSundell's Codextended - https://github.com/JohnSundell/Codextended
- Binary Bird's  [plural-kit](https://github.com/BinaryBirds/plural-kit)
