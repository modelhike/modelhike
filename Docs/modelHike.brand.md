# What Modelhike stands for

### 🏕️ Core Metaphor: **Hiking through Software Architecture**

- You’re not just drawing diagrams — you’re on a **guided expedition** through your system’s terrain.
- Each level of C4 modeling is an **elevation gain** — from high-level context to detailed code.
- The DSL is your **map**, previews are **viewpoints**, and structure is your **trail**.

------

### 🌲 Core Feelings It Should Evoke:

- **Joy**: like reaching a summit or discovering a shortcut trail.
- **Clarity**: like reading a map that just makes sense.
- **Momentum**: like having a clear path with no friction.
- **Exploration**: like uncovering insights as you go.

------

### 🎨 Visual & UX Principles:

- **Contour line aesthetics**: background curves that hint at depth, layers, relationships.
- **Topographic themes**: colors, shading, icons from hiking maps.
- **Elevation transitions**: smooth navigation between model levels.
- **Minimalist Linear Design**: soft, focused UI that respects developer flow.

------

### 📚 Vocabulary You Use Throughout:

- **Trailhead** = dashboard or project start
- **Compass** = navigation or tools
- **Viewpoints** = different diagram views or stakeholder perspectives
- **Trail Guide** = documentation
- **Waypoints** = decision markers
- **Terrain Analysis** = architecture health checks
- **Base Camp** = saved workspaces
- **Expedition Log** = version history
- **Leave No Trace** = clean modeling/code hygiene

------

### 💬 Language & Tone:

- Friendly, crisp, and **developer-centered**
- Uses **journey language**, but never gets in the way
- Clear, not clever — but with **little sparks of delight**

------

### 💡 Why This Matters:

This consistent brand:

- Makes modeling **fun** and **approachable**
- Builds long-term memory: people remember *ModelHike*, not just “yet another modeling tool”
- Reinforces your **differentiator**: combining structure, markdown-like ease, AI-power, and joy.
